		<p>Marvelous Software is the label I created for my software products.  I firmly believe in
		quality software.  It only takes a little more time during designing and testing to make a big difference
		in the effectiveness of the software.  I know my users appreciate it even if they don't!</p>

		<h1>First time I saw a computer</h1>
		<p>I remember the first time I saw a computer, I was 11 or 12.  It was at the Florida State Fair
		but I dont remember the exhibit.  It was running a program that had 10 math questions.  I 
		had to enter the answer for each one.  One question had a zero in 
		the answer and I pressed the letter 'O'.  An attendant told me I needed to press the <i>other</i> 'O'
		because it would not work.  This piqued my curiosity and I told them I wanted to enter it anyway.  They told
		me I can but I would get the question wrong.  So I proceeded and they were correct.  But I was more content knowing
		what happens getting a 90 then I would've getting the 100.</p>
		<br>
		<h1>I became interested in programming</h1>
		<p>During high school a friend of mine introduced me to the computer lab.  We would go therre during our free period.
		Initially we played games.  Then I 
		started getting interested in programming.  I wondered what would happen if I turned the printer on when I played a 
		game.  Would it print each screen like a frame from a film?  Or would it just print the screen updates? I tried it
		and nothing happened!  My friend gave up on it but it just made me even more curious.  Eventually I learned that the
		printer doesn't work with graphics the way I turned it on.  I taught myself Appelsoft basic.  Then I took a computer class
		and I did learn some things in the class but most of the stuff I already knew.  It was the easiest A I ever received.  
		Due to my prior experirence I was able to help many of the students with their labs.  Self-teaching became a hallmark 
		in my career as did teaching others.  Bonus fact: I only skipped one class in high school, and it was by accident.  The high
		school I went to (Andrew Ward) would mix up the classes in the later part of the day.  If you went to the wrong class
		it quickly became apparent because your classmates were different.  Even if you did not notice, the teacher would when they
		took attendance.  Unless it was your free period, and you went to the computer lab and were so interested in the computer
		you never noticed that therre were different people there.  Fortunately when I explained it to my teacher i did not get into
		any trouble.  I don't think he even reported me absent.  I did, however, pay closer attention to the scheduled periods!
		</p>
		<br>
		<h1>First program: War</h1>
		<p>I entered program listing I found.  I learned the power operator, "^", so modified one that would print multiplication tables
		to print numbers squared.  To my astonishment, the computer told me 7 ^ 2 was 49.00001 and I couldn't figure out what I did wrong.
		Someone provided me a solution, they said to use the Int function.  This really confused me since I knew the answer and the computer was wrong!
		This is when I learned that computers could lie.  Then I finally got to the point where I could write my own program, the card game of War.
		I completed the program, although it wasn't much fun.  Flipping over the card was the most exciting part of the game and I eliminated that
		with my program.  I only finished a game once.  I made other programs, my most ambitious 
		</p>
		<br>
		<h1>First computer: Apple //e</h1>
		<p>I paid $700 for a used 1 (yes, that's right, one) MHz PC.  It did have double memory though, instead of the standard 64k it had
		an enhanced 80 column card with an additional 64k for a whopping 128k.  The problem with that was that it was inaccessible from BASIC.
		In order to use it you had to switch banks of RAM.  So basically you could only use 64k at one time.  As for hard drive, 0MB.  There was none.
		The 5.25 floppies held 143k, but in practice, you ended up with 129k.  Just floppies, no hard drive.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h1>First post high school class: Computer Processing Institute</h1>
		<p>I tried applying for programmer jobs, but the best I got was a "We'll keep yopur resume on file for future reference."
		Being unable to find a job in computers I took a 6 month class at <i>CPI</i> which taught JCL, machine language and COBOL.  
		This was significantly different form the PCs I used in high school, which were either an Apple //e or Apple ][+.
		I would always finish my work early and would either help others or mess around on my own.  My instructor game me an alternate
		way to run COBOL.  Normally we submitted jobs then examined the output.  I either did that or would view the output onb the screen.
		I also got my first income from programming here.  They had a label program using GW-Basic.  They paid me to make a modification for them.
		This experience allowed me to get a job as a computer operator with <i>Dun & Bradstreet's DunsCenter</i>.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h1>First job: Computer Operator</h1>
		<p>Working at <i>DunsCenter</i> was a rich learning 
		experience.  I first learned Rexx, which is an interpreted language on the mainframe.  I used this to message people about any open tickets
		they may have.  I used MVS's broadcast message to accomplish this.  I also learned ISPF panels, which is
		a way to simulate windows on a dumb terminal, albeit without much of the functionality like moving a window.  Before
		VBA came out, Microsoft Word used something they called WordBasic for macros.  This I used for creating na shared address list so employeeslearned
		can create letters in word and not have to enter an address if someone already created a letter and entered the address which was stored in a
		random access text file.  Catching the managers attention, they bought Control-O which is automation software for the mainframe.
		Then I was given a task to write code to shut down the mainframe.  Testing it was difficult cause the testbox was much easier to shutdonw
		then the production system.  And the system only got shut down once a week.  But when the automatice shutdown was completed
		the system would be down in 5 minutes when it would usually take the operator about a half an hour.  This required me to 
		work a few Saturday nights to test my rules (the code for Control-O was set up in a library of "rules" which were similiar to
		functions but triggered in a variety of ways like commands, messages, conditions or other rules).  A couple of times 
		the night shift operators told me they 
		raced through the shut down procedure and got the machine shut down between 12 and 15 minutes.  It reminded me of the 
		story of John Henry.  I automated a number of things, erasing of tapes, label printing, message responses and anything
		we could think of.  This is where I learned the more work you automate does not eliminate your job, it just gives you more work!
		Here where I first learned VB and that moved me to writing code on the Windows PC.

		<h1>Wanna be a programmer?  Tested!</h1>
		<p>When <i>DunsCenter</i> moved from the mainframe to PCs they shutdown the Stamford office and offered me a job in New Jersey.  
		I did not wish to move to New Jersey so I went job hunting.  I saw a job for a VB programmer at <i>High Point Systems</i> and and applied.  Since
		I had little VB programming experience on mmy resume my future boss gave me a test but interrupted me before I was able 
		to complete it.  I thought "oh boy, I must've done really bad."  He then asked me how much I wanted, so I told him and I was hired.
		While I was taking the test I couldn't remember how to open a file for output.  I was afraid to look at the help during the test.    but 
		time was going by, and I wasn't getting it right.  I remember thinking I don't care if I dont get the job, I just wanted to
		finish my program.  I told my new boss this and he told me he looks at help all the time.  I was never afraid to look at help again.
		My first task was working on a customer service application
		for Bloomingdales.  I had to change a form that was using this stuff called SQL.  I never even heard of SQL before.  I remember
		thinking "how can they ask me to work on code I never even heard of!"  Little did I know at the time, but this was to be how my
		career would evolve.  I worked on many projects, and I even installed Oracle.  When the database wouldn't install I had to call them.
		They told me the manual was wrong and walked me through the procedure.  Cant trust the manual?  Another valuable lesson!
		</p>
		<br>
		<h1>Now I'm a consultant</h1>
		<p>After speaking with a consultant I became convinced that was the next step for me.  I informed my boss I was quitting giving him 30 days notice.
		He seemed he was expecting it since he replied "I was hoping you would stay until my son's bar mitzvah."  Then he wished me good luck.
		Then I was working for Fitlinxx, a gig I really enjoyed.  They wanted to hire me but I was set on being a consultant.  My boss liked my work
		and he fought to keep me on board.  When he left the company they informed me that I had 30 days until they would not need me anymore.
