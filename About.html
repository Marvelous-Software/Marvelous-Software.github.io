		<p>Marvelous Software is the label I created for my software projects.  I firmly believe in
		quality software.   It only takes a little more time during designing and testing to make a big difference
		in the effectiveness of the software.  I know my users appreciate it even if they don't!</p>
		<br>
		<p>I remember the first time I saw a computer, I was 11 or 12.  It was at the Florida State Fair
		and it had 10 math questions.  I had to enter the answer for each one.  One question had a zero in 
		the answer and I pressed the letter 'O'.  There was a person who told me I needed to press the <i>other</i> 'O'
		because it would not work.  This piqued my curiosity and I asked them if I can push it anyway.  They told
		me I can but I would get the question wrong.  So I proceeded and they were correct.  But I was more content knowing
		what happens getting a 90 then I would've getting 100.</p>
		<br>
		<p>During high school I would go to the computer lab and I taught myself basic.  Then I took a computer class
		and I did learn some things in the class but t was the easiest A I ever received.  Due to my prior experirence
		I was able to help many of the students with their labs.  Self-teaching became a hallmark in my career.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Being unable to find a job in computers with nothing to show for it, no work experience, no degree and no certificate
		I with to a 6 month class which taught JCL, machine language and COBOL.  This allowed me to get a job as a computer operator.
		There was a rich learning experience.  I learned Control-O which is automation software for the mainframe.  I wrote code to shut
		down the system in 5 minutes when it would usually take the operator about a half an hour.  A couple of times they told me they 
		raced through it and got it down between 12 and 15 minutes.  It reminded me of the story of John Henry.  I also learned REXX and
		ISPF panels, which looked like windows on the dumb terminals, albeit without much of the functionality like moving a window.  It was 
		here where I first learned VB.</p>
