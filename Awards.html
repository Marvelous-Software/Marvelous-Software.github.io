		<p>I won a contest and had my name published in a magazine ad with some of my code (and received a free copy of the magazine).  I saw the magazine 
		in the store and decided to check it out. The magazine was <i>Contract Professional</i>
		and it had an article "Projects from Hell."  Since I was never involved in any disaster projects I thought
		it may be wise to be prepared incase I ever ended up in a situation like that.  Maybe spot signs early?  Who knows?</p>

		<p>There was an ad that had some code which displayed "IT doesn't get any better than this!" and
		you could figure it out because it was a recursive function and all the text was there.  Well
		when I went to the web site to enter the answer they challenged me to come up with a better code puzzle.  Since I'm a coder
		that is precisely what I did!</p>

		<p>I used a formula to encode the letters.  And just to make sure no one could figure it out I
		included a random number (which isn't really random) so the only way to get the answer would 
		be to run it on the computer.  I chose a random number seed that would include a quote in the
		encrypted text for a little extra something.  It says "Bet you needed more than a pencil and paper to get this one!"
		I won.</p>
