		<p><a class='link' href='http://www.sqlsaturday.com/' target='_blank'>SQL Saturday</a> is a cool event. 
		They have several lectures about various aspects of SQL Server and related subjects.  I particularily like
		the one in New York City (NYC) since it is held in the Microsoft office.  There's a good view of Radio City Music Hall.
		I always thought it would be cool to work there but I suspect the NYC office just has sales people and accounts,
		boring stuff.</p>
