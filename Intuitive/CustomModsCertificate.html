		<p>Some customers required certificates for the parts we made.  This was an Access report that needed to be moved to .Net
		The vendor was deciding (for a few years) on something to replace Access with.  This particular report was difficult since
		some parts had serial numbers and these needed to be on the certificate.  We decided to use the PrintDocument
		to get this moved over but wait on the other reports.</p>

		<p>I really like automating things as much as possible so whenever a shipment record was created I would checked
		to see if this customer / part combination needed a certificate and automatically print one out.  But sometimes they
		would need a certificate after the part was shipped.  that is what the Certificate Reprint is for.</p>
