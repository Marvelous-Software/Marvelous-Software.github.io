		<p>The modifications I made to the customer card were minor.  Notes were added where users
		can add anything they needed to.  Customers also required to be <a href='#'>Screened</a> so a task for
		this was added.  Both tasks can be accomplished by clicking the link on the left or at the bottom
		of the screen.  If a customer's screening was never done or out of date a red button would appear
		both informing them of the situation and allowing them to correct it.  The customer is read only if
		a screening need to be done.  There is also a notes button that appears when a note was entered that
		brings the user to the notes form.</p>
