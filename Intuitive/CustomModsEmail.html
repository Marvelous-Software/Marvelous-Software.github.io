		<p>We had a module that is used to create e-mails.  These e-mails can be modified by a form to change
		the contents and / or recipients.  This mod also had parameters that could be inserted into the
		body or subject of the message.  I included these parameters into a context menu making it easy to 
		add them where needed.</p>
