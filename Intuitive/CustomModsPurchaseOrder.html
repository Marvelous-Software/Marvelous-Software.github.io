		<p>The purchase order card has several modifications.  Screening has been added for the vendor.  Notes can be created on the header and lines as well as
		phrases entered on the line items.  But the coolest modifications were the item quantity breakdown and the setup and tooling 
		charges.</p>

		<p>The item quantity breakdown allows tracking how much of the purchase is for stock and how much is for production (a customer order).  Basically two extra buckets
		are added that accept stock and production values.  These get totalled and entered into the required quantity field so the system functions properly.  The
		extra buckets are used for reporting purposes.</p>

		<p>The system is designed for the setup and tooling charges to be entered as misc lines.  The problem with this is that if there is more than one item 
		on the purchase order there is no way to track the costs on a per item basis.  As the system stands, the only solution is to create separate purchase orders.
		But this can cause issues of its own.  This was solved by adding the setup and tooling charge fields on the item line.  This provides cost per item tracking.
		When values are entered in the item line identical charges are created on the misc lines which allows the system to handle for accounting purposes.</p>
