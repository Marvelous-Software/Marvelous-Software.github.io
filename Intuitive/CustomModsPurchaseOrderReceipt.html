		<p>This was a very simple mod to the form.  We just needed to add a counted by field. Behind the scenes there is a label printing function.
		There is no interaction with the user.  When they save the receipt record label(s) will automatically print to be applied
		to the inventory.  The form calls a custom dll that I wad writted in .Net to replace the VB3 version (which used UDP).  This dll uses TCP to send data to a label
		server.  This label server was also written by me to replace a VB3 version which would create a file in a directory
		which another server program supplied by the Intermec printer vendor would scan and then print.</p>
