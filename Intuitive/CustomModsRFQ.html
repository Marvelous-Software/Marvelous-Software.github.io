		<p>The existing RFQ card did not meet the business requirements so a custom version was created in Access
		along with a custom table structure in SQL Server.  Basically its a RFQ header table linked to a RFQ Items table which is linked to
		both a RFQ ItemQuantity table and a RFQ Vendor table.  The Access form was replaced by a .Net form.  The reports remained in Access
		until they can be converted to the new Aptean-DevXpress reporting structure.</p>
		<br>

		<p>Basic RFQ information gets entered at the top.  The 'Clauses' are the phrases and the double chevron on the left will bring up 
		the dialog.  The DevXpress grid allows the combining of tables and their children so the RFQ items, item quantities
		and vendors can all reside in the same grid.  Note the addition of use class and Ex Lic (Export License).</p>
		<br>
		<p>The formal tab is used for outward-facing documents as opposed to the worksheet (in the task list on the left).  When I was
		with the users observing how they used the Access form to see if I can make any improvements I was amazed.  They would print
		a RFQ then take it to the scanner, scan it to a pdf then attach the pdf to an e-mail to send to the vendor!  I can improve this.
		I found some VBA code online that would turn an Access report to a pdf.  All the drivers that do this require a file name.
		The users don't care about this step, and I wanted it to be seamless.  I then created a basic e-mail form with the minimum (sender, subject, body 
		and attachments) which I would send using SMS.  I could even pull some of the vendors e-mail from the vendor table.  So in the best case all the users 
		had to do was click "send as e-mail" on the RFQ card, enter any special instructions in the body then click "send."
		I was proud of that ROI.</p>
