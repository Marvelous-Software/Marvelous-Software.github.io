		<p>We had a stand-alone VB app that we could use to manage (index and view) RFQs received from the vendor.
		When I was asked to convert it to .Net I decided to incorporate it into the ERP application.  This avoided referencing
		the same tables and fields in two different applications.  In the ERP system I created constants for any database table
		or field I needed to reference.  This means I can rename a field or table in the database and only one place needs
		to be changed in the code.  Also putting thius functionality in the ERP application means I can use their data manager
		so some SQL I would not have to write.</p>

		<p>What they would do is scan in the vendor replies.  Often times they would print out e-mail responses from the vendors so they
		can scan them in.  They wanted to keep a hard copy for their records.  I wanted to keep it digital but old habits die hard.
		So, keeping with their current system, after they would scan in the replies to a staging directory I could display the files in a grid.
		When a grid line was selected I would display the image.  Then the user can go through the tedious process of manually entering
		the information and save (Accept).  There are better ways to do it IMHO.</p>

		<p>Viewing the replies was much more straight forward.  A filter existed to look them up by Item, RFQ, Vendor or date range.
		Once the desired filters are applied the user can look through the results uin a grid.  Selecting an item in the grid displays it on 
		the screen.  An option was added to allow printing.</p>
