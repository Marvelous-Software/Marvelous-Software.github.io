		<p>The sales order card has several modifications.  Screening has been added for the customer.  Notes can be created on the header and lines as well as
		phrases entered on the line items.  The biggest challenge was working with the export compliance.  Unfortunately I do
		not have a screenshot of the export licenses on the sales order.</p>

		<p>The sales order relies on export data and sometimes an export license.  The system in Access had the sales order form
		with modifications and an export data form plus an export license form which tracked the steps in the process (Initiate, Submit, Amend, Withdraw
		and Aprove) and this form also assigned the sales order.  Well I converted the sales order card.  When it came time to 
		convert the export data it became obvious to me that this belongs on the sales order.  It saves the user time because they dont
		have to go to another form, enter the data and assign it to a sales order (potential source for errors).  They just enter the data.</p>

		<p>The export licensing was tricky.  I suspect thats why they saved it for last.  When the system was created an export license was needed for
		each order if it fit the criteria.  Then the state department allowed blanket licenses.  Get a license that covers a million dollars 
		of goods and you can send as many orders as you want to the sane customer until you reach the dollar value (or close to it).  The plant manager, 
		who was also the export manager, tracked all this in a spreadsheet.  I cringed when I saw it but at the same time was glad they asked me to fix it,
		this is what I do.  I created a new export license form that tracks the steps.  There was no sales order information on it.  I then added a grid
		on the sales order card where export licenses can be assigned.  But we still needed to track the dollar value and this could not be done on the
		sales order because sometimes parts get shipped out differently than what is specified on the sales order.  Say there's an AOG (Aircraft On the Ground)
		The customer may want a partial shipment as soon as x number of parts are ready.  So a partial shipment can occur.  I added a dropdown where
		the shipper must select an export license if required before a shipment record is created.  Querying the shipment table we can calculate the
		dollar value for an export license.</p>

		<p>Another mod was adding quote lookup capability.  A dropdown was added to the sales order line grid where the user can select a quote.  When the
		user selects a quote another dropdown populates with the items from that quote.  When an item is selected the item id in the grid gets filled in and
		the price from the quote is entered.  Works well.  There were some other fields added for data entry but one that I was concerned with was the certificate
		required field.  If this was set then I generated a certificate at the time of shipment.</p>
