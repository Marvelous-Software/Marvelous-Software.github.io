		<p>Due to the nature of the business customers and vendors need to be "screened" so as to make
		sure they aren't bad guys or people who deal with bad guys.  Some parts are classified as defense articles, like 
		a bolt used to mount a machine gun.  Others are classified as dual use like landing gear.  Both an attack helicopter 
		and a commercial one may use the same landing gear.  The state department has strict regulations governing the
		sale and exportation of some parts.</p>

		<p>Several points during the processing we check for a valid screening.  Screenings do expire and the expire interval is different
		at different points in the software.  Shipment is the strictest requiring a screening that day before a
		shipment record is created.</p>

		<p>For example if a customer is loaded that was never screened, has a screening that is out of date
		or deliberatly marked as denied then a dialog appears informing the user and giving them the choice
		on how they wish to procede.</p>

		<p>If the user has permission to perform screenings and they choose to then the screening form is displayed
		allowing them to enter a screening or mark them as a denied party.</p>
