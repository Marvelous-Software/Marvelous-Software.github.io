		<p>The shipment card has some modifications with the certificate printing occuring behind the scenes.  Screening has been added for the customer.  		
		This is the most important screening since this is the last chance to stop a shipment from going to someone whom it should not.  A screening needs to be 
		done on the day of the shipment.  Selecting an
		export license is mandatory when required.  Unfortunately I do not have a screenshot for this but all it does is enable and populate a combobox 
		with export licenses that were entered on the sales order card.  When a shipment
		record is created, if specified on the sales order, a certificate is created and printed.</p>
