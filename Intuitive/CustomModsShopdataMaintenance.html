		<p>A simple, yet significant change was needed for the shop data maintenance.  Since the U.S. Army is a customer, their
		regulations require periodic inspections.  During one such inspection they became concerned when an employee enters their
		hours for a work order.  Since the computers in the shop are shared, different employees can use the same ERP login.  This
		gave the possibility of an employee entering hours for someone else.  We never had that problem, however the army wished
		to eliminate the possibility of that happening to ensurre accountability.  So a password field was added to the employee
		card and when the user selects an employee to log hours for (always themselves) a password dialog appears and will not
		let the user procede until they enter their password.</p>
