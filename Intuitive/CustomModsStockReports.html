		<p>These were all Access reports.  Some of them were very complex.  There was a query a couple of dozen lines long.
		Another one would execute a query, loop through it and issue other queries.   All of them populated a table which the reports
		pulled from.  I never figured out what they were doing but was able to convert them to stored procedures.  I could then
		put the results in a grid with the capability to export to an Excel file.  Once the data was confirmed correct I was done.</p>
