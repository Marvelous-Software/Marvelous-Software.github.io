		<p>This was a cool mod that had a better than expected ending.  We would get a spreadsheet from part suppliers or manufacturers.  This information was
		handy when we needed to request a quote.  But everyone had thier own idea of what the spreadsheet should look like and contain.  Sometimes prices, sometimes
		quantities but always the part number.  My boss would manually take the data and build SQL statements to put it in the database.  When I got hired
		this was passed to me.</p>
		<br>
		<p>As soon as I saw this automation bells went off.  I requested to build a form to handle this.  He told me it wouldn't work, they're all different.  I said
		I can make it work with what we have and update it when different ones come it.  He said it would take a lot longer to write the code then to just manually do it.
		I said, you're right, but it nwill pay for itself in time.  He nrelented and this is how this form was created.  It checks the columns for part numbers by
		quering the database.  Since they can have parts that are not in our database there is a percentage threshold which can be modified under statistics.  It also
		tries to find prices and quantities.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>When the form load it checks a specific directory for any excel files and populates a dropdown.  When one of these is selected a grid gets populated
		with the raw data (right grid) and the program tries to identify the columns.  It gets it right most of the time since the spreadsheets are usually structured pretty good.
		The user has the option to assign / reassign columns in case the program misses them or gets them wrong.  Then the user clicks a <i>Convert</i> button missing 
		from the screenshot (that image was an earlier version).  Another grid (left grid) gets populated with item ids and any matches to the ones in our
		database will display the item name.  When the user is satisfied they click import and the data goes in the table.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Now comes the best part.  I don't know if anyone noticed, but I started talking about a task I was given then I was describing the actions of "the user."
		That is easy to explain.  When the owner say how easy I made it to import the data he reassigned the task to one of the clerks.  So now this mundane data massaging task
		went from my boss, to me then out of the IT department entirely!  I really automating processes,</p>
