		<p>The modifications I made to the vendor card were minor.  Notes were added where users
		can add anything they needed to.  Vendors are also required to be screened so a task for
		this was added.  Both tasks can be accomplished by clicking the link on the left or at the bottom
		of the screen.  If a vendor's screening was never done or out of date a red button would appear
		both informing the user of the situation and allowing them to correct it.  The customer is read only if
		a screening needs to be done.  There is also a notes button that appears when a note was entered that
		brings the user to the notes form.</p>

		<p>Interesting fact is that the vendor and customer both used different bining objects in 8.5.  When I updated the 
		customer card it used the imsAppObjectComponent.  This made it impossible to use the same code in the vendor card,
		which used the newer imsAOBinder due to a different event structure.  The good news is the customer card has been updated 
		with the new binder in 8.6.
