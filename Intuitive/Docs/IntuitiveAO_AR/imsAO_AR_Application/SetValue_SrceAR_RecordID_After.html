        <h2>Summary</h2><br>
         This trips off a whole gaggle of value and schema changes. <br>
        <h2>Remarks</h2><br>
         This field links the application line to the Ledger Row that it applies to.
          If that changes the source doc fields need to change and the balances of the
          old and new Ledger rows needs to be adjusted.

          For a Primary App this indicates the secondary ledger item it applies to.
          For a Secondary this links it to the applying primary.  For the secondaries, 
          the fields are supplied by the primary so we don't worry about them here.
