        <h2>Summary</h2><br>
         Legder rows represent physical source documents such as Invoices and Checks.  How these
          documents affect other documents is defined via the Application rows.  This object allows
          defining and maintaining the Ledge rows.  Once a row is written no changes are allowed
          to it's dates or monetary fields.
<br>
        <h2>Remarks</h2><br>
         There are two major input routines: Invoice Posting and A/R Application (cash receipts).
          Invoice Posting also covers finance charge assessment and revaluation.  As Invoicing is a 
          non-interactive process but Applications is an interactive one they have different requirements
          as far defaults and cacasading SetValues (setting the trans currency amount automatically
          changing the Local amount and vice-versa, for example).  For this reason, there is a 
          SetupMode flag.  Interactive (the default) is used for Applications, NonInteractive for 
          Invoicing (it must change the flag).

          A/R Ledger rows are children of the Posting summary under which they were created.  However,
          their applications are often children of a different Posting summary.  This causes a bit
          of a problem when ledger transaction a queued as to which Posting summary to use.  This is solved
          by having a ARPS_RecordID_InEffect field on the ledger record.  It is set by the inputting
          routine and is the value that the Application rows retrieval to be connected with the 
          'mother ship'.  This value is cleared when a Save(PreocessNow = True) occurs.

          Speaking of parents...  There are four client routines (originally) that can create new ledger
          rows: Applications, Invoicing / Finance Charges, Revaluation, and Trans Queue / EDI.
