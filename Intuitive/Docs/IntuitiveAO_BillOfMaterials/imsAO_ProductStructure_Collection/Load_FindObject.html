        <h2>Summary</h2><br>
        
    Called by the framework when trying to locate an existing subdomain object.  It is necessary to do more than
    just provide alternate look-up fields as the main field, (PST_)IMA_RecordID is not normally supplied but its evil
    sister, IMA_ItemID (played by lPST_CompItemID) is.  So we need to do an ID to GUID conversion first and then do the look up.
 
    The minimum fields required to do a look up are the Item ID and the Effective Start Date.  If Route Sequeunce is provided,
    it is used, too.  Success is defined as one and only one row matching the criteria.
 <br>
        <h2>Returns</h2><br>
         Hopefully, the datarow for the intended PST row to be changed. <br>
