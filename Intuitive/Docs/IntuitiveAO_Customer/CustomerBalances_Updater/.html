 Helper object for routines that change data used to determine any of the balances in
 the CustomerBalances table except A/R.  <br>
        <h2>Remarks</h2><br>
        
 Instantiate and then call BeforeChanges to get the current balances. After the database
 has been changed but beofre the changes are committed, call the AfterChanges to have
 the new balances read, the differences calced and the changes posted to CustomerBalances.  
 
 The before and after balances are accessible. Obviously, changing them will cause 
 pyschological issues later on in life.   <br>
