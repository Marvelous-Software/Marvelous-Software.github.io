        Member resides in the <a href='..\imsAO_ContactRelation.html'>imsAO_ContactRelation</a> Class<br>
        <h2>Summary</h2><br>
        
This class handles the relation between a Contact and another entity like a Customer or ShipTo
<br>
        <h2>Remarks</h2><br>
         This class is a bit wierd in that it not only handles the data from the contactrelation table, but it also
          creates an interior Contact object and loads and maintains that. By merging the Schema from the ContactAO we 
          are able to do Gets/Sets on the contactRelation and it goes to the Contact AO. It's like a joined domain, but it's
          not read-only.
