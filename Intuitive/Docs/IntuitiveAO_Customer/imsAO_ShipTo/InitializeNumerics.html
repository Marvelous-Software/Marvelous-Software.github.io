        <h2>Summary</h2><br>
         This routine loops through the fields collections and sets the amounts = 0 for numeric data types. <br>
        <h2>Remarks</h2><br>
         Routine removed from the AO FX; its only use was in this class. The version below is not an exact
          copy of the original routine as this version uses SetValue whereas the original version
          changed the value directly on the field object (a bad idea, IMHO). <br>
