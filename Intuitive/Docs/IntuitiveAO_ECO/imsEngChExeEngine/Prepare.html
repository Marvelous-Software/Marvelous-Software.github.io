        <h2>Summary</h2><br>
        
 Prepares the ECD for execution.
 <br>
        <h2>Remarks</h2><br>
        This method prepares the ECD for execution. It combines the ECDs into a set of
 execution tasks that are used to save the data to the database. The tasks are sorted
 into the execution order and are ready for execution. As long as there were no App 
 Errors returned, execution has a high likely hood of succeeding.To elaborate, execution tasks can be a combination of multiple ECDs. For example,
 the imsAO_EngChDoc_PST record represents a single line in a BOM. All of a BOMs lines 
 within a ECD are consolidated into a single imsEngChExeTask_PSH_Update task in order to 
 be saved as a whole.<br>
        <h2>Returns</h2><br>
        If imsReturnData.AnyAppErrs is True, the ECD cannot be executed.<br>
