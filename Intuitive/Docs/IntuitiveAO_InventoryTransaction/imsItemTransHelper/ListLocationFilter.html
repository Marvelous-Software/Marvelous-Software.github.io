 Returns the filter used by the dataview that is returned from ListLocation.
 <br>
        <h2>Remarks</h2><br>
        
 Overrides this method to get change the list of locations returned by ListLocations.
 Usually the only place this would be overriden is during Inspected Receipts or Inspection
 type transaction where they want to only list the inspect location (WIPInspect, POInspect, RMAInspect).
 So for example, to limit the list to just POInspect locations include this as your override
 in the derived ItemTransHelper:
 
     Public Overridable Function ListLocationFilter() As String
         Return "(MWL_LocationName = 'POInspect')"
     End Function
 <br>
        <h2>Returns</h2><br>
        String to filter the dataview returned by ListLocation.<br>
