     Virtually all logical fields are derived in two ways.  First, they look with the hope that the field value has already been set.  This
     is the case if in Create From Shipment or Audit as the routines set the fields are they are available.  If the field value has
     not been set then the routines check that the source field isn't null and, if not, retrieve the data.
