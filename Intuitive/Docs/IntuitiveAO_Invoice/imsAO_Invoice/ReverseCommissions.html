        <h2>Summary</h2><br>
         Called from Save_Ancillary during the Reverse Invoice function.  <br>
        <h2>Remarks</h2><br>
         The routine first does a join between the invoice lines and the commission
          transactions.  This is done to minimize database hits and needless attempts
          to instantiate commission objects.  The data table returned from the join is
          then used to guide the reversal process.  As the record ids are known, the
          routine takes advantage of that fact and instantiates a minimum of commission
          objects.
