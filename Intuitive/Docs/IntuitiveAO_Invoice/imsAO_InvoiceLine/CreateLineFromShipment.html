        <h2>Summary</h2><br>
         Routine called by the header CreateFromShipment to create invoice lines. <br>
        <h2>Remarks</h2><br>
                                                            
     As with the header, it is assumed that the data is valid.  Looks up are therefore suspended
     and r2d2 is not checked very often to see if any errors did occur.
