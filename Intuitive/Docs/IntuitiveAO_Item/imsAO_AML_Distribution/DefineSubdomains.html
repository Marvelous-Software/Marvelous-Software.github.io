        <h2>Summary</h2><br>
         Define the Subdomains for this level and parameters about them. <br>
        <h2>Remarks</h2><br>
         Subdomains are children app objects to this app object.  A such they are collection class objects; 
          peers are not handled here.  This code creates a collection of the Subdomain collection classes so that
          functions such as Load and Save can handle the kids polymorphically. 
          One Add is placed for each Subdomain.          <br>
