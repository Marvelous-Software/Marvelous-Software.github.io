        <h2>Remarks</h2><br>
        
The main pPegging thread linking source to use is the EIA_GuidKey to EIA_ParentGuidKey relationship within a given EIA record
These primary relationships are supplemented by other source to use relationships in the EIA_Linkages table
Records are written to EIA_Linkages whenever a given source has multiple uses.  Think of this table as an inverted BOM (ok, its a where-used)
Such situations arrise when order policies such as POQ or weekly buckets or look-ahead causes MRP or CTP to generate one
supply order that covers multiple demands.  Or, when CTP combines multiple planned purchase orders generated within a CTP
session into a single planned PO due at the earliest due date that then covers the multiple requirements within that session.
So... the first relationship is built into EIA, and any additional relationships that need to be tracked are in EIA_Linkages
Tracing upwards is not a problem since we can branch upwards by exploding along the main relationship and when that
runs out, continue exploding up the additional relationships per the EIA_Linkages table.  This works through multiple levels
of additional relationships.
However... exploding downward is more painful because we don't know ahead of time what items we will be hitting due to the 
additional relationships.  I call this thread-switching when we encounter these other relationships.
I hate to hit the database every time we reach what we think is the bottom of a pegging branch, but I don't see a way to avoid it.
