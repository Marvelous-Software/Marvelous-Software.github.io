        <h2>Summary</h2><br>
        Change the font from or to colored on longest leadtime node path.<br>
        <h2>Remarks</h2><br>
        Need to recurse thru the entire tree saving the longest duration as each
         node is processed. Duration is blank if a node has not been visited before.
         A node will only be processed once. If the total duration has already been
         calc'd it will be skipped. After the entire tree has been checked, return
         to the node with the longest duration and bold the parent chain until the
         top of the tree is reached.<br>
