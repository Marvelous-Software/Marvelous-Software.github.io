        <h2>Summary</h2><br>
         
          Forecasts are handled in batches that are all or nothing as far as updating the database.  As such, this object is
          (1) an entry point to be called by the Trans Queue processor and (2) a controller that creates other Forecast objects and collects
          their SQL.  The SQL is stashed in the variable mTX_R2D2 which is then passed back to the Trans Queue Processor and executed when it calls Save 
          on this object.
<br>
        <h2>Remarks</h2><br>
        
         - A Forecast batch is defined by the document tag.   Only one batch should appear in a trans queue row.
