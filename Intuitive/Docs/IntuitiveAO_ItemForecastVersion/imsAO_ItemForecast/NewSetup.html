        <h2>Summary</h2><br>
         Set up tasks for a new document. <br>
        <h2>Remarks</h2><br>
         Called by the client or the collection class to start a new object.  
          The base checks to make sure a document isn't already loaded and 
          and tests Phantom requirements --> so it is necessary to call it.        
          This is where defaults should be set and so forth.  <br>
