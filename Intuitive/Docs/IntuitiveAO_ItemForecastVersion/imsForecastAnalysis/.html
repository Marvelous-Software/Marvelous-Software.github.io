        <h2>Summary</h2><br>
        Provide sales forecast presentation and analysis services to UI layer<br>
        <h2>Remarks</h2><br>
        Note that the actual netting of sales to forecasts takes place within IntuitivePlanning.imsActivityLoader.
         The routines exposed here leverage that netting process to package 
         things up nicely for the UI or provide searching features to hunt
         for forecasts that are under or over sold.
