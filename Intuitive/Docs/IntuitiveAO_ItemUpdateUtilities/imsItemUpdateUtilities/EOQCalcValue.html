        <h2>Summary</h2><br>
        Calculate the EOQ here with these steps
Top Line of Formula
Step 1 - Multiply avg monthly usage by 24 ("AvgMonthlyUsage" in itemTable)
Step 2 - Multiply usage by order cost
Bottom Line of Formula
Step 3 - Multiply Accounting value of the item by carrying cost ("IMA_AcctValAmt" in itemTable)
         Must make sure that acctg value is NOT zero
Step 4 - Divide step 2 results by step 3 results
Step 5 - Take square root of step 4 results and write EOQ value to itemTable
<br>
        <h2>Remarks</h2><br>
        24 is used as a constant because the APICS formula is annual demand * 2.
So I have multiplied monthly usage times 24 to get 2 years of demand.
