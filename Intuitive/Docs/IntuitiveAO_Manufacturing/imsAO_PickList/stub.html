 Aligning the Satellites
 <br>
        <h2>Remarks</h2><br>
        
 Aligning the various Item identifier satellite fields is a tricky task.  I have used the 
 following pattern successfully in several app objects.  Most tables have a foreign key 
 field to either IMA_ItemID or to IMA_RecordID.  Some even have both!  But, the user is 
 forced to enter the IMA_NoRevisionItemID and IMA_RevLevel seperately in all cases
 when item values are required.  First they pick the NoRevisionItemID and the default 
 RevLevel is defaulted in.  Then they have the opportunity to change the RevLevel.  
 When they change the logical RevLevel then we must go sync up the IMA_ItemID and/or IMA_RecordID.  
 
 The problem is that SetValue recursively fights against you.  
 
 IMA_ItemID
 IMA_RecordID
 IMA_NoRevisionItemID
 IMA_RevLevel
