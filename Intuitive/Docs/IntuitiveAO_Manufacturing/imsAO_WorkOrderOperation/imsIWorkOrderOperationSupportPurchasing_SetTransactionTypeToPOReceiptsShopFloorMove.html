        <h2>Summary</h2><br>
        
 The transaction type is based on an enum defined here.
 This project references AO_PurchaseOrder, which uses this
 app object and needs to set the TransactionType.  But it can't have
 a reference to here or else we'd have a circular reference.
 So this Interface allows us to get around that.
