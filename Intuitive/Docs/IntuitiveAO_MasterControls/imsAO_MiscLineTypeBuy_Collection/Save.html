 Persists document and changes to the database or the transaction queue. <br>
        <h2>Remarks</h2><br>
         
 Following Save the app object is marked terminated. 
 R2DT is used to the accumulte transactions.  R2D2 is used for the results of the last call so that
 if an error occurs just the results of that call are returned and not the cummulative results as well. 
 If the Save is a success then R2DT is passed back.  <br>
