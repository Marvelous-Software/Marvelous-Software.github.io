        <h2>Summary</h2><br>
         
 Defines the Subdomains for this domain and their characteristics. Do not call base method. <br>
        <h2>Remarks</h2><br>
         
 Having the empty method in the base allows the ctor to call it whether it
 has been used in the derived class or not. The derived class defines its Subdomains in the method. 
 The method is called by the ctor to create the Subdomain defintions objects. <br>
