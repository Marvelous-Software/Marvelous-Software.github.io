        <h2>Summary</h2><br>
        If the Price Matrix is new, we make sure that an Price Matrix for the
customer, customer type, soldto, item, product family and currency does not already exist for the active date range.
In addition, the price breaks are checked to make sure there are no gaps or overlapping.<br>
        <h2>Remarks</h2><br>
         Following a successful Save the app object is marked as Terminated. <br>
