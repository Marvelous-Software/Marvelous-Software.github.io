        <h2>Summary</h2><br>
         This routine is called from the Line Collection class.  The special processing flag (X) has already been taken care of there
          so all we worry about here is if this is Add/Change/Delete.
<br>
        <h2>Remarks</h2><br>
         The special processing flag has been edited by the collection class and the 'X' has already been taken care of.  So all we need
          to deal with here is the regular processing type (A/C/D) is passed in with the line number in the Batch Nbr arg.
