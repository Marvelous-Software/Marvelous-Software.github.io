        <h2>Summary</h2><br>
         This routine is called from the Line Collection class.  The special processing flag (X) has already been taken care of there
          so all we worry about here is if this is a Replace and Add/Change/Delete.
<br>
        <h2>Remarks</h2><br>
         The special processing flag has been edited by the collection class. Also, the 'X' has already been taken care of.  So all we need
          to deal with here is an 'R'.  The regular processing type (A/C/D) is passed in with the line number in the Batch Nbr arg.
