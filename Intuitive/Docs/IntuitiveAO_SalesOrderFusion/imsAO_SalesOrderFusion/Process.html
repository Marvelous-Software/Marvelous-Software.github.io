        <h2>Summary</h2><br>
         Controlling function for the work flow. <br>
        <h2>Remarks</h2><br>
         This routine is intended to be called by the misc. invoicing UI.  It handles all
          processing step automatically.

          The function may be called a couple of seperate times due to call outs to the UI.
          What the next step is to be is handled via the mNextStep variable.  
          If the UI needs to do something, that something is put into the ProcessingMessage.
         
          Exceptions are trapped so that processing to the point of the exception can be
          backed out.  A processing exception is then thrown with the original exception
          stashed in its inner exception.
 
          To abort the routine, call ProcessAbort.
     
          Payments are handled by the UI as that is always a connect to the payment form.  If
          process thru payment is indicated the routine returns as completed after the invoicing
          step.
