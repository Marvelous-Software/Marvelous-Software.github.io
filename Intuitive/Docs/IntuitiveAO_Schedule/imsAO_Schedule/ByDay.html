        <h2>Summary</h2><br>
         Create a schedule for the case when the recurrence pattern chosen is by day. <br>
        <h2>Remarks</h2><br>
         The data used here is recurrence pattern 'Occurs Every X Days' from Schedule Start.  
          Basically, the routine begins with the start date and then loops adding X days until the stop 
          date is reached.  For each scheduled date, the times are then determined.   
          Optimization determines a 'window' within the schedule that is meaningful for determining if 
          the time is due and limits determing the times to within the days in that window.  If we
          are talking a schedule that pops every minute for several years this ends up saving
          many thousands of useless calculations.  <br>
