        <h2>Summary</h2><br>
         Start up routine if the monitor is started as a stand-alone exe.   <br>
        <h2>Remarks</h2><br>
         In theory, the form will run from the menu if recompiled as a dll.  I have not
          tested this as there is no requests to do this.                    <br>
