        <h2>Summary</h2><br>
         Handles creating a new rule via a Template (new) or an existing rile (copy).
          Note that when done for an existing rule, MainAO is passed and then gets reset by this routine.

          If all goes OK, the Rule Details panel is displayed.  If not, the error is displayed and r2d2 is
          returned with the error; the caller is responsible for the display at that point. <br>
