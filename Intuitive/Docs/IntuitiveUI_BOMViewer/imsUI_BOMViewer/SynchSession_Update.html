Allows forms to synchronize with each other.

        <h2>Remarks</h2><br>
        To become a synch session consumer, hook up a handler to the imsSynchSession.Update event. When 
the event is raised, check to make sure the synch key is what you are expecting and then update the 
form based on the value.The most common way to get a session is for it to be passed in through the Execute args parameter. 
When that occurs, the form should be initialized based on the settings in the synch session.The other way to get a session is to hook up to the imsSynchSession.CommonSynchSession. This route 
typically involves a checkbox in the header that the user can check to synchronize the form 
with the session.<br>
