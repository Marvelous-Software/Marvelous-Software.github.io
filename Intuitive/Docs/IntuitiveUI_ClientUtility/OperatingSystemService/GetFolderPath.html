 This is a replacement for the  method which is capable of properly retrieving "All User Profile" folders.
 Use the Environment method if it supports the folder type you require, otherwise use this method to obtain these types of folders as the folder paths are quite different from WinXP to Vista.  Attempting to construct a path by going after the "AllUsersProfile" environment variable is not sufficient<br>
