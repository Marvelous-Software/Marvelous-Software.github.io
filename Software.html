		<p>One thing I can say is VS is remarkably static.  Thats not to say 
		is hasn't changed.  There have been numerous changes throughout the years, but many things have
		stayed the same.  when I call it static I am comparing it to either windows, where you get
		a new job learning how to use the operating system almost anytime you upgrade or Office, where
		you get to play "where did they put this feature?"  Sure you can expect to need to learn some stuff
		when you upgrade but not almost everything.   Fortunately marketing didn't get thier hands on VS.</p>

		<p>Being the only ERP software I have worked with I can't really compare it to anything.  But 
		being a developer, I really like how you can customize nearly every aspect of it.  This came in handy 
		dealing with government regulations and export compliance.</p>
